    <p class = "about-paragraph">
      Nkomo’s Fried Chicken began with a simple dream and a family recipe passed down through generations <br> 
      crispy, flavorful chicken made with love, care, and a touch of township spirit.<br>
      What started as a small shop in D Section, serving locals who came for a quick bite and stayed for the taste, <br>
      has grown into one of the community’s proudest success stories.<br>
      Founded and run by a dedicated father-and-son duo, Nkomo’s Fried Chicken represents more than just great food. <br> 
      It’s a story of hard work, faith, and family unity. Together, they turned a small idea into a thriving<br> 
      business that continues to bring people together one meal at a time.<br>
      From those early mornings in the township kitchen to opening multiple branches across town,<br> 
      the journey has been built on consistency, quality, and an unshakable belief that good food can change lives.<br> 
      Every piece of chicken served is a reminder of where it all started in D Section, where flavor met passion and community<br>
      support turned a local dream into a national ambition.

      <p>At Nkomo’s, we believe in growth without forgetting our roots. We continue to create opportunities, <br> 
        support local suppliers, and inspire young entrepreneurs to believe that success can come from anywhere even from the heart of the township. <br>

    <p>Our Promise</p>

<p>- To serve food that tastes like home — crispy, juicy, and full of soul. <br>

- To create a welcoming space for everyone, from families to first-time visitors. <br>

- To keep expanding with the same passion and pride that started it all. <br>
</p>
<p>Nkomo’s Fried Chicken isn’t just a restaurant — it’s a legacy of love, perseverance, and community.</p>
